                                    <h4>An App to Rank Cities based upon user selected factors</h4>
								</header>
								
                                <p>This project was put together over the course of eight weeks by a team of 14 students with four disciplines - UX, iOS, Full Stack Web, and Data Science. We were given two weeks to plan, five weeks to build, and one week to clean and present our documentation. Much of the user research and data collection had been done by a previous team. There were two DS students on this team. Between the two of us, my role was to clean data, build a model for sorting cities by multiple factors, and to create data visualizations. My DS partner worked primarily on building our API to connect our model to both the iOS and web teams. I spent most of the five weeks of build-time alternating between Jupyter Notebooks and pair programming with my DS partner to integrate my work into our API.
                                </p>

                                </header>
								<p>
									After a day of initial data wrangling, I cleaned and reduced our data to the largest 256 US cities with populations of about one hundred thousand or larger. Our API would give our web developers access to 189 city features ranging from: crime safety ratings, economic growth factors, school ratings, diversity, air quality, etc. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The overall goal was for the first release cycle was for our model to return a list of top recommendations based upon which factors a user selected as important to them. The hope was to eventually add sliders to each selected feature, to be able to weigh relative importance of each factor. Even with this relatively tiny data set and without adding weighted relative importance, the number of possible ranked lists based exceeds 3*10³⁴⁹; my team needed a live model. 
								</p>
								<p>
									First I created a simple function using pandas manipulations.
								</p>
                                </p>
                                <!-- Preformatted Code -->
								<pre><code># returns df filtered by quantile of factors

def rankify(df, factors, top=10, quant=.75):
	df_copy = df.copy()
	for i in factors:
	df_copy = df_copy[df[i] > df_copy[i].quantile(quant)]
	df_copy['score'] = df_copy[factors].mean(axis=1)
	df_copy = df_copy.sort_values('score', ascending=False)
	return df_copy['name'].head(top).tolist()</code></pre>
                                <p>
									For a given input dataframe and  list of factors, the above function takes only the cities that appear in the intersection of the top 25% for each of the factors listed. In other words, a city with a low score in any of the categories listed is axed from the list. From there, a mean is taken across each row to provide a relative score for comparing to other cities, and cities are sorted by the resulting values.                         
								</p>
								<p>
									Although the results from this initial function had some pretty glaring issues, by handing over this minimally viable product to my team, they were able to start working on integrating it into our app, while I improved my model and further cleaned my data.
								</p>
								<p>
									Issues - 1. Different factors were on vastly difference scales. For example, population might vary on the scale of millions, while economic growth usually  varies on partial  percentages. Whichever factor had the biggest numbers had the biggest influence on the overall rank. To begin to fix this, I used a min-max scaler, shrinking the range of values for all factors to be from zero to one. 2. While I pushed these slight improvements, another issue occurred to me - distribution.
								</p>
								<!-- Preformatted Code -->
								<pre><code>import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
# from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Instantiate
# scaler = StandardScaler()
mms = MinMaxScaler()
rscaler = RobustScaler()

#Isolate numeric columns
numeric = robust_df.select_dtypes('number')
x = numeric.values

# Impute NaNs with means
imp_mean = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
imp_mean.fit(x)
SimpleImputer(add_indicator=False, copy=True, fill_value=None,
missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean', verbose=0)
x = imp_mean.transform(x)

# Scale / Normalize / Standardize
# x_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(x)
x_scaled = rscaler.fit_transform(x)
x_scaled = mms.fit_transform(x)
df_temp = pd.DataFrame(x_scaled, columns=numeric.columns, index = robust_df.index)
robust_df[numeric.columns] = df_temp</code></pre>
								<p>
									Even while the scale was made the same between factors, the skew of distribution was widely different from one factor to another. If a factor had a strong right-skew (left leaning) distribution, then the resulting upper quartile was had a bigger range than if it were left-skewed. This gave more influence to factors with right-leaning distributions. After playing with a number of scalars and normalizers, the best results were given by sklearn's Robust Scaler. However, even it was not completely fair between factors due to irregularities in distributions.

                                <p>
									Finally, it occurred to me that what I was looking for was a flat distribution which could be accomplished much easier by simply ranking each factor using pandas own built-in .rank() function.
