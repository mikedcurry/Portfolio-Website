                                    Even so, for the sake of containment, efforts can be more efficiently focused on

                                    After running a cleaned the survey data through a selected model 
                                    (XGBClassier), the relative predictive power of each variable was assessed and 
                                    ranked according to importance. Of all the information collected in the survey,
                                    79 factors were found to help our model accuractely predict infection. 

                                    Proximity was, not too surprisingly, among the top contributing factors for 
                                    predicting Ebola infection. 

                                    Perhaps the most interesting finding is the strong relative importance of other 
                                    disasters faced by the community during the time of the outbreak. Drought, food shortages,
                                    flood, conflict, and other calamities all greatly increased a community's likelihood of
                                    having Ebola infection. 

                                    Other major contributing factors include: the time it takes one to get treatment when needed, 
                                    if representatives from health
                                    network organizations were active in the community, whether the community had access 
                                    to a women's health professional, if fruit was sold at the local market, access to 
                                    a dedicated facility for child birthing, the proximity to a boarder crossing.

                                    <h4>Shapley Values for Model's Worst Prediction</h4>
                                </header>
                                <p><span class="image"><img src="images\shapley_low.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    For the village of Peivalor, our model predicted only a 2.2%
                                    probability of the community having any cases of Ebola. However, there was
                                    in fact at least one unconfirmed case of infection. 
                                    
                                    Inspecting the plot above, the top two factors decreasing likelihood of infection: (1) this is a 
                                    relatively small community of 18 households; (2) the local market does not sell
                                    fresh fruit. 
                        
                                    On the lefthand side in red, the top factor that lead our model to predict an increased 
                                    infect risk was that the community had no person or facility designated for giving birth. 
                                    The next two biggest factors were interrelated. The member of the community surveyed specified that 
                                    there were other disasters experienced by the community during the outbreak, but the nature of the 
                                    coinciding diaster was either not disclosed or was not included in the report.                         
                                </p>

                                    <h4>Shapley Values for Model's Most Certain Prediction</h4>
                                </header>
                                <p><span class="image"><img src="images\shapley_high.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    The village of Oremai was given the highest probability of infection at 97%. All 
                                    told, this village of 100 households experience 4 cases of Ebola. 
                        
                                    Most notably from the diagram, there simply does not appear to be very many 
                                    factors in this village's favor. The largest factor contributing to our model
                                    predicting an infection in this community was that it experience two major 
                                    disasters during the same time as the outbreak. The next largest factor was
                                    the amount of time the it takes for the average community memeber to get to and
                                    return from a treatment facility.
